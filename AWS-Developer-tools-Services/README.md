# AWS Developer Tools

AWS Developer Tools help **developers build, test, and deploy applications efficiently** on AWS. These tools provide CI/CD pipelines, version control, deployment automation, and monitoring.

## 1. AWS CodeCommit

**Description:**  
AWS CodeCommit is a **fully managed source control service** that hosts Git repositories. It allows teams to store and version code securely.

**Key Features:**
- Private Git repositories.
- Integrated with AWS IAM for access control.
- Supports Git commands and standard workflows.

**Example Use Case:**  
A development team stores their **microservice code** in CodeCommit. Developers push code changes, which trigger automated builds and deployments.

## 2. AWS CodeBuild

**Description:**  
AWS CodeBuild is a **fully managed build service** that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts.

**Key Features:**
- Build environments with preinstalled tools or custom Docker images.
- Scales automatically based on build volume.
- Integrates with CodeCommit, CodePipeline, and GitHub.

**Example Use Case:**  
A team pushes code to CodeCommit. CodeBuild compiles a **Java application**, runs unit tests, and produces a JAR file ready for deployment.

## 3. AWS CodeDeploy

**Description:**  
AWS CodeDeploy automates **application deployments** to EC2 instances, on-premises servers, Lambda functions, or ECS.

**Key Features:**
- Blue/Green or Rolling deployments.
- Automated rollback on deployment failure.
- Integrates with CodePipeline and CloudWatch.

**Example Use Case:**  
After CodeBuild generates the application artifact, CodeDeploy deploys it to **10 EC2 instances** using a rolling deployment. If an error occurs, it automatically rolls back to the previous version.

## 4. AWS X-Ray

**Description:**  
AWS X-Ray helps **analyze and debug distributed applications** in production or development. It provides **end-to-end request tracing**, helping developers identify bottlenecks and errors.

**Key Features:**
- Trace requests across microservices.
- Visualize service maps and latency issues.
- Detect errors, exceptions, and performance bottlenecks.

**Example Use Case:**  
A user reports slow response from a web app. X-Ray shows that **the database query in one microservice is taking 500ms**, while other services respond within 50ms. Developers optimize the query to improve performance.
