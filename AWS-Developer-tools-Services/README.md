# AWS Developer Tools

AWS Developer Tools provide **services for DevOps automation, CI/CD, and monitoring** to help developers build, test, deploy, and monitor applications efficiently in AWS.

---

## 1. AWS CodeCommit

**Description:**  
CodeCommit is a **fully managed source control service** that hosts Git repositories securely in the cloud.

**Key Features:**
- Supports Git commands and workflows.
- Fully managed, scalable, and secure.
- Integrates with AWS IAM for access control.

**Example Use Case:**  
A team stores their application code in CodeCommit instead of GitHub. Developers push code to the repository, and commits trigger CI/CD pipelines in CodePipeline.

---

## 2. AWS CodeBuild

**Description:**  
CodeBuild is a **fully managed build service** that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces artifacts ready for deployment.

**Key Features:**
- Scales automatically based on build volume.
- Supports custom build environments with Docker.
- Integrates with CodeCommit, GitHub, and CodePipeline.

**Example Use Case:**  
When a developer pushes code to CodeCommit, CodeBuild automatically runs unit tests, compiles the application, and creates a deployment artifact for further stages in CodePipeline.

---

## 3. AWS CodePipeline

**Description:**  
CodePipeline is a **continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service** that automates the steps required to release applications.

**Key Features:**
- Automate build, test, and deployment stages.
- Integrates with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and third-party tools.
- Supports parallel and sequential pipelines.

**Example Use Case:**  
A web application pipeline:
1. **Source Stage:** Pulls code from CodeCommit.
2. **Build Stage:** CodeBuild compiles and runs tests.
3. **Deploy Stage:** CodeDeploy deploys to EC2 or Lambda.

---

## 4. AWS CodeDeploy

**Description:**  
CodeDeploy automates **deployment of applications** to EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or on-premises servers.

**Key Features:**
- Supports in-place and blue/green deployments.
- Reduces downtime during deployment.
- Integrates with CodePipeline or works standalone.

**Example Use Case:**  
A company deploys a new version of a web app to EC2 instances using CodeDeploy with a **blue/green deployment strategy**, minimizing downtime for end-users.

---

## 5. AWS X-Ray

**Description:**  
X-Ray helps **analyze and debug distributed applications** by tracing requests across services.

**Key Features:**
- Collects data on requests as they travel through your application.
- Generates service maps to visualize dependencies.
- Identifies performance bottlenecks and errors.

**Example Use Case:**  
A microservices-based e-commerce app uses X-Ray to trace a customer checkout request across EC2, Lambda, and RDS services. The team identifies a slow database query causing checkout delays.
