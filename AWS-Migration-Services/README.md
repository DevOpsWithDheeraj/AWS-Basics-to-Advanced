# üåê AWS Migration Services

## üß© Overview

**AWS Migration Services** help organizations **move applications, data, and workloads** from on-premises environments, data centers, or other clouds to the **AWS Cloud** ‚Äî securely, efficiently, and with minimal downtime.

AWS provides **tools, frameworks, and best practices** to simplify the **assessment, migration, and modernization** process.

## üß≠ 2. 6 R‚Äôs of Cloud Migration Strategy

AWS classifies migration strategies into **6 R‚Äôs**, which help determine the best approach for each workload.

| Strategy                                       | Description                                                                   | Example                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Rehost (‚ÄúLift and Shift‚Äù)**              | Move applications **as-is** to AWS with little or no changes.                 | Migrate VMs from on-premise to EC2 using MGN.              |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ Replatform (‚ÄúLift, Tinker, and Shift‚Äù)** | Make **minor optimizations** for better performance or cost before moving.    | Move app to EC2 but use RDS instead of self-managed DB.    |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ Refactor / Re-architect**                | **Redesign** the application to take full advantage of cloud-native features. | Move monolithic app to microservices on AWS Lambda or ECS. |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ Repurchase**                             | Replace the existing application with a **SaaS-based solution**.              | Replace CRM with Salesforce or ServiceNow.                 |
| **5Ô∏è‚É£ Retire**                                 | **Decommission** or remove applications that are no longer needed.            | Turn off legacy tools or duplicate systems.                |
| **6Ô∏è‚É£ Retain (Revisit / Re-evaluate)**         | Keep some workloads **on-premise** due to compliance or latency reasons.      | Keep mainframe workloads locally for now.                  |

## üß± 3. 5 Phases of AWS Migration Process

AWS Migration journey generally follows **five key phases**, as defined in the **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)**.

| Phase                                      | Description                                                               | Key Activities                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1Ô∏è‚É£ Discovery & Assessment**             | Understand the current IT landscape and define migration goals.           | Inventory workloads, identify dependencies, and perform TCO analysis.     |
| **2Ô∏è‚É£ Mobilize**                           | Build the foundation for migration and address gaps found in assessment.  | Set up Landing Zone, security, governance, and pilot migrations.          |
| **3Ô∏è‚É£ Migration & Modernization**          | Move workloads to AWS using the right 6R strategy.                        | Execute migrations using MGN, DMS, or DataSync.                           |
| **4Ô∏è‚É£ Validation & Optimization**          | Verify migrated workloads and optimize for performance & cost.            | Conduct testing, performance tuning, and cost optimization.               |
| **5Ô∏è‚É£ Operation & Continuous Improvement** | Operate migrated applications efficiently with automation and monitoring. | Use CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and AWS Config for governance and monitoring. |
