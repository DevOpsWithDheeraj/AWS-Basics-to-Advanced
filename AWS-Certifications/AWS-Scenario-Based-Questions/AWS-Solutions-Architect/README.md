## 🧠 **3. Detailed Syllabus Breakdown**

### ✅ **Domain 1 — Design Secure Architectures (30%)**

Focus on secure access and workloads:

✔️ Designing secure access to AWS resources (IAM, roles, federation) <br>
✔️ Using AWS security best practices (least privilege, MFA, shared responsibility) <br>
✔️ Application and data security strategies <br>
✔️ Network traffic protection, encryption, secure endpoints <br>
✔️ Security services like AWS IAM, AWS KMS, Security Groups, SCPs <br>

---

## 🧪 **4. What the Exam Tests You On**

The exam *doesn’t just ask you to recall facts* — it tests your ability to apply AWS services and architectural best practices in real‑world scenarios, such as:

* Choosing services based on architectural requirements
* Designing hybrid cloud or decoupled systems
* Applying best practices from the AWS Well‑Architected Framework
* Interpreting requirements and constraints correctly ([AWS Documentation][1])

---

## 📘 **5. Recommended Hands‑On Areas**

While not an exhaustive list, AWS typically expects knowledge in key services such as:

* **Compute:** EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling
* **Storage:** S3, EBS, EFS
* **Networking:** VPC, Subnets, NAT Gateway, Load Balancers
* **Security:** IAM, KMS, Security Groups
* **Databases:** RDS, DynamoDB
* **Monitoring & Ops:** CloudWatch, CloudTrail
* **Decoupling:** SQS, SNS, EventBridge
* **Content Delivery:** CloudFront
  These are often referenced in scenarios so strong hands‑on familiarity is important. ([Reddit][7])

## 📝 **Exam Tips**

✅ Understand *why* a service fits a scenario, not just *what it does*
✅ Practice scenario‑based questions (not just MCQ drills)
✅ Review **AWS Well‑Architected Framework** best practices
