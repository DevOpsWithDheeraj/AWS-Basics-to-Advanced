## **💡 What is TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)?**

**TCO** is the **total cost of running your IT infrastructure** over time. It’s not just the price of servers or software; it includes **all the costs involved in owning and operating a system**, whether on-premises or in the cloud. 🏢💻☁️

Think of it as a **big picture view of cost** — upfront, operational, and hidden costs — so you can compare **AWS cloud vs. on-premises**.

### **📊 Components of TCO**

When calculating TCO, we usually consider:

1. **Hardware Costs** 💽

   * Servers, storage, networking devices, etc.

2. **Software Costs** 🖥️

   * Licenses, OS, database software, security tools.

3. **Operational Costs** ⚡

   * Power, cooling, data center space.

4. **Labor Costs** 👷‍♂️

   * Admins, IT staff, maintenance.

5. **Other Costs** 🛠️

   * Backup, monitoring, security, support, upgrades.

### **☁️ AWS vs On-Premises Example**

Suppose you want to run a **web application** for your company for **3 years**.

| Cost Component      | On-Premises    | AWS Cloud                        |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Servers & Storage   | ₹15,00,000     | ₹0 (pay per use)                 |
| Software Licenses   | ₹5,00,000      | ₹50,000 (managed services)       |
| Power & Cooling     | ₹3,00,000      | ₹0 (AWS handles it)              |
| Labor (Admin staff) | ₹6,00,000      | ₹1,00,000 (AWS managed services) |
| **Total TCO**       | **₹29,00,000** | **₹1,50,000**                    |

✅ **Observation:**
Moving to AWS drastically **reduces upfront and operational costs**. You **pay only for what you use** and don’t worry about maintenance.
