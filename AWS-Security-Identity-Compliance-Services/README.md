# üîê AWS Security, Identity & Compliance Services

---

## **1. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

**IAM** enables secure control of access to AWS services and resources for users, groups, and roles.

### **Key Features:**
- Create **Users, Groups, and Roles**.
- Assign fine-grained **permissions via Policies**.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) support.
- Federated access using external identity providers.

### **Example:**
A company creates IAM roles to allow EC2 instances to access S3 buckets securely without embedding credentials in the code.

---

## **2. AWS KMS (Key Management Service)**

**KMS** is a managed service for creating, managing, and controlling **encryption keys** used to protect data across AWS services.

### **Key Features:**
- Centralized key management and rotation.
- Supports symmetric and asymmetric keys.
- Integrated with S3, EBS, RDS, and Lambda for encryption.

### **Example:**
An application encrypts sensitive customer data stored in **S3** using a KMS key, ensuring data is secure at rest.

---

## **3. Amazon Cognito**

**Cognito** provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile apps.

### **Key Features:**
- User sign-up, sign-in, and access control.
- Integration with social identity providers (Google, Facebook, Amazon).
- Supports multi-factor authentication and token-based authorization.

### **Example:**
A mobile app uses Cognito to manage users, allowing login via Google or email/password and providing temporary AWS credentials for secure API access.

---

## **4. AWS Directory Service**

**Directory Service** enables AWS resources to integrate with **Microsoft Active Directory (AD)** or create a managed AD in AWS.

### **Key Features:**
- Managed AD in the cloud.
- Single Sign-On (SSO) for AWS resources.
- Integration with EC2, RDS, and applications that use AD authentication.

### **Example:**
A company hosts Windows servers on EC2 and uses Directory Service for centralized authentication and group policy management through AWS Managed Microsoft AD.

---

## **5. AWS RAM (Resource Access Manager)**

**AWS RAM** allows you to **share AWS resources securely** across AWS accounts, Organizational Units (OUs), or the entire organization.

### **Key Features:**
- Share resources like VPC subnets, Transit Gateways, or License Manager configurations.
- Centralized management for cross-account access.

### **Example:**
A parent company shares a VPC subnet with its subsidiaries using **AWS RAM**, enabling secure access without duplicating resources.

---

## **6. AWS Secrets Manager**

**Secrets Manager** helps protect and manage sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and tokens.

### **Key Features:**
- Securely store and rotate secrets automatically.
- Fine-grained access using IAM policies.
- Integrates with RDS, Lambda, and other AWS services.

### **Example:**
A web application retrieves database credentials from **Secrets Manager**, which automatically rotates the password every 30 days without code changes.

---

## **7. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**

**ACM** simplifies the **provisioning, deployment, and management of SSL/TLS certificates** for securing websites and applications.

### **Key Features:**
- Free public SSL/TLS certificates for AWS services.
- Automatic certificate renewal.
- Integrates with CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancer, and API Gateway.

### **Example:**
A website hosted on **CloudFront** uses ACM to provision an SSL certificate, enabling HTTPS without manually managing the certificate lifecycle.

---

## **8. AWS Security Hub**

**Security Hub** provides a **centralized view of security alerts and compliance status** across AWS accounts.

### **Key Features:**
- Aggregates findings from AWS GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, and third-party tools.
- Provides compliance checks using AWS best practices and standards (CIS, PCI DSS, etc.).
- Customizable automated actions and alerts.

### **Example:**
A security team monitors multiple AWS accounts through **Security Hub**, receiving alerts for unencrypted S3 buckets and misconfigured security groups.
