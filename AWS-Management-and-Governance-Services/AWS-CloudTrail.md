# 🕵️‍♂️ **Amazon CloudTrail — Auditing and Governance Service**

---

## 🧠 1. **What is AWS CloudTrail?**

**Amazon CloudTrail** is an **auditing, compliance, and governance** service that records **API calls and user activities** across your AWS account.

It provides a detailed **history of who did what, when, and from where** in your AWS environment.

> 💡 In simple words:
> **CloudTrail = CCTV camera of your AWS account** — it records every action performed on your AWS resources.

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Purpose**

CloudTrail helps you:

* Track **user activity and API usage**
* Audit **security and compliance**
* Detect **unauthorized access or changes**
* Troubleshoot **operational or permission issues**
* Analyze **resource usage and trends**

---

## 🧩 3. **Key Components of CloudTrail**

| **Component**         | **Description**                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Event**             | Record of an API call or action taken in AWS (e.g., `StartInstances`, `CreateBucket`).         |
| **Trail**             | Configuration that enables delivery of events to **S3** or **CloudWatch Logs**.                |
| **Event History**     | Default log of the past 90 days of management events (available in the console).               |
| **Management Events** | Actions performed on AWS resources (e.g., creating or deleting EC2, IAM, S3).                  |
| **Data Events**       | Operations performed inside data resources (e.g., S3 object-level actions, Lambda invocation). |
| **Insights Events**   | Detect unusual activity patterns (e.g., sudden increase in API calls).                         |

---

## 🪜 4. **How CloudTrail Works**

1. **User or Service Action:**
   Someone (or something) performs an API call — for example, creating an EC2 instance or modifying an IAM policy.

2. **Event Recording:**
   CloudTrail records the **who, what, when, where, and how** of that event.

3. **Storage:**
   Logs are stored in:

   * **Event History** (default, 90 days)
   * **S3 Bucket** (for long-term storage)
   * **CloudWatch Logs** (for real-time analysis)

4. **Monitoring & Analysis:**
   You can analyze logs using:

   * **CloudWatch Insights**
   * **AWS Athena** (SQL queries on S3 logs)
   * **Security tools** (e.g., GuardDuty, Security Hub)

## 🔍 5. **Types of Events in CloudTrail**

| **Event Type**        | **Description**                         | **Example**                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Management Events** | Changes to AWS resources                | `CreateUser`, `RunInstances`, `AttachRolePolicy` |
| **Data Events**       | Access to resource content              | `GetObject` from S3, `InvokeFunction` in Lambda  |
| **Insights Events**   | Detect unusual patterns in API activity | Sudden spike in `TerminateInstances` calls       |

---

## 💡 **Examples**

---

### 🧱 **Example 1: Tracking EC2 Instance Creation**

You want to know **who launched an EC2 instance** and **when**.

**Steps:**

1. CloudTrail records an event like:

   ```json
   {
     "eventSource": "ec2.amazonaws.com",
     "eventName": "RunInstances",
     "userIdentity": {
       "userName": "dheeraj.kumar",
       "sourceIPAddress": "103.55.33.21"
     },
     "eventTime": "2025-10-30T08:45:23Z"
   }
   ```
2. You can view this in **CloudTrail Event History** or search in **Athena**.

📘 **Outcome:**
You now know exactly **who launched** the instance, **from where**, and **at what time** — great for audits and debugging.

---

### 🪣 **Example 2: Monitoring S3 Object Deletions**

Your S3 bucket suddenly lost critical files. You need to find out **who deleted them**.

**Steps:**

1. Enable **Data Events** for that S3 bucket.
2. CloudTrail records object-level API calls like:

   ```
   DeleteObject
   PutObject
   GetObject
   ```
3. You can filter for `DeleteObject` actions in the logs.

📘 **Outcome:**
You discover that **user “test-admin”** deleted the object using the AWS CLI at **10:02 AM**.
✅ Root cause found using CloudTrail.

---

### 👮 **Example 3: Detecting Unauthorized Access**

You notice suspicious activity — IAM roles modified at odd hours.

**Steps:**

1. Enable **CloudTrail Insights**.
2. It automatically detects abnormal activity like:

   * Unusual number of failed login attempts.
   * Sudden spike in sensitive API calls (e.g., `DeleteTrail`, `DetachRolePolicy`).

📘 **Outcome:**
CloudTrail alerts you via **CloudWatch Alarm**, allowing quick security response.

---

### 📊 **Example 4: Long-Term Audit with S3 and Athena**

You store all CloudTrail logs in an **S3 bucket** for compliance.

Then, use **Amazon Athena** to run SQL queries:

```sql
SELECT userIdentity.userName, eventName, eventTime
FROM cloudtrail_logs
WHERE eventName = 'DeleteBucket'
AND eventTime > '2025-10-01';
```

📘 **Outcome:**
Easily generate **audit reports** and meet compliance requirements like **ISO 27001**, **SOC2**, or **HIPAA**.

## 🚀 8. **Real-World DevOps Use Case (Infosys Scenario)**

As a **DevOps Engineer at Infosys**, you maintain AWS environments shared by multiple teams.

You configure:

* A **Trail** that sends CloudTrail logs to an **S3 bucket**.
* Stream those logs to **CloudWatch Logs** for near real-time monitoring.
* Set up **Athena** queries to audit who:

  * Deleted EC2 instances
  * Modified IAM roles
  * Changed security group rules

✅ **Result:**
You gain **complete visibility and accountability** for every action across your AWS environment.
Perfect for **security audits**, **incident response**, and **root-cause analysis**.

## 🧩 9. **CloudTrail vs CloudWatch vs Config**

| **Service**    | **Purpose**                                            | **Example**                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **CloudTrail** | Logs *who did what* (API calls & user actions)         | User deleted S3 bucket       |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitors *how systems perform* (metrics, logs, alarms) | EC2 CPU > 80%                |
| **AWS Config** | Tracks *resource configuration changes*                | Security group rule modified |
