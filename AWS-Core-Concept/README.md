# ☁️ AWS Core Concepts

---

## **1. What is Cloud Computing**

**Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources—such as servers, databases, storage, networking, and software—over the internet (“the cloud”) with pay-as-you-go pricing.  
Instead of investing heavily in physical hardware or data centers, organizations can rent computing power and services from cloud providers like **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- **On-Demand Access:** Provision resources anytime without manual setup.  
- **Scalability:** Easily scale up or down based on workload.  
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Pay only for what you use.  
- **Reliability:** High availability with redundant systems across global regions.  
- **Security:** Strong compliance and encryption standards.

### **Example:**
A startup can deploy its web application using AWS without buying servers. As traffic grows, it can increase capacity instantly using services like **EC2 Auto Scaling** or **Elastic Load Balancer**.

## **2. AWS Global Infrastructure**

AWS operates one of the largest and most secure cloud infrastructures in the world, designed for high performance, scalability, and resilience.

### **Key Components:**
- **Regions:** Physical locations around the world (e.g., Mumbai, Virginia, Frankfurt). Each Region consists of multiple isolated and physically separate data centers.  
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Individual data centers within a Region. They are interconnected with low-latency links, ensuring fault tolerance and high availability.  
- **Edge Locations:** Data centers located closer to end users, used by **Amazon CloudFront** (CDN) to cache content for faster delivery.

### **Example:**
If you deploy your application in the **Mumbai Region (ap-south-1)**, AWS automatically distributes resources across multiple AZs within that region for better resilience.

## **3. Shared Responsibility Model**

AWS follows a **Shared Responsibility Model**, clearly defining which security and compliance responsibilities belong to AWS and which belong to the customer.

### **Responsibilities:**

| **AWS (Security *of* the Cloud)** | **Customer (Security *in* the Cloud)** |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Physical security of data centers | Data encryption and access management  |
| Hardware and software infrastructure | Configuring firewalls, security groups |
| Network and virtualization layers | Operating system patching and updates  |

### **Example:**
AWS secures the EC2 infrastructure, but you are responsible for managing security patches, OS updates, and IAM permissions for your EC2 instance.

## **4. AWS Management Console & CLI**

AWS provides multiple interfaces to manage and interact with its services.

### **AWS Management Console:**
A **web-based graphical interface** that allows you to access, configure, and monitor AWS resources visually.  
- Ideal for beginners and administrative users.  
- Provides dashboards and monitoring features.  

### **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface):**
A **command-line tool** that allows developers and system administrators to manage AWS services programmatically using terminal commands.  
- Enables automation through scripts.  
- Useful for large-scale resource management and DevOps pipelines.

### **Example:**
- Using Console → Launch an EC2 instance with a few clicks.  
- Using CLI → Run `aws ec2 run-instances` to automate instance creation.
