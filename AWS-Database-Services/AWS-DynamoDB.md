# Amazon DynamoDB 

## What is Amazon DynamoDB?

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS that supports key-value and document data models. It offers fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB eliminates the operational overhead of running and scaling distributed databases, allowing developers to focus on building applications rather than managing database infrastructure.

Key characteristics of DynamoDB include:

* **Managed Service:** AWS handles hardware provisioning, setup, configuration, replication, software patching, and scaling.
* **Serverless Architecture:** No need to manage servers; automatically scales throughput and storage.
* **Low Latency:** Single-digit millisecond response times at any scale.
* **Flexible Data Model:** Supports key-value and document data models.

## Key Features of DynamoDB

### 1. Fully Managed

* No need to worry about infrastructure, software patching, or replication.
* Handles fault tolerance and replication across multiple availability zones.

### 2. Performance at Scale

* Can handle millions of requests per second with low latency.
* Supports **Provisioned Throughput** (manual) and **On-Demand Mode** (auto-scaling).

### 3. Data Model

* **Tables:** Collection of items (like rows in relational DB).
* **Items:** Individual records (like a row).
* **Attributes:** Fields within an item (like columns).
* **Primary Keys:** Unique identifiers for items (Partition Key or Partition + Sort Key).

### 4. Secondary Indexes

* **Global Secondary Index (GSI):** Allows querying on non-primary key attributes.
* **Local Secondary Index (LSI):** Allows different sort key for the same partition key.

### 5. High Availability & Durability

* Replicates data across **multiple AZs** automatically.
* Supports **point-in-time recovery (PITR)**.
* Automatic backups and snapshots.

### 6. Security

* **Encryption at Rest:** Using AWS KMS.
* **Encryption in Transit:** TLS for secure connections.
* **IAM Integration:** Fine-grained access control per table.
* VPC Endpoints to access DynamoDB privately.

### 7. Streams & Triggers

* **DynamoDB Streams:** Capture table activity for replication, auditing, or triggering AWS Lambda functions.

### 8. Event-Driven Integration

* Integrates with AWS Lambda for serverless applications.
* Supports triggering events on insert, update, and delete operations.

### 9. Cost Efficiency

* Pay for what you use with On-Demand mode.
* Cost depends on read/write throughput, storage, and optional features.

## DynamoDB Architecture

DynamoDB uses a distributed architecture to achieve high performance and scalability:

* **Partitions:** Data is split across multiple partitions based on partition key.
* **Replication:** Each partition is replicated across multiple availability zones.
* **Query Processing:** Uses partition key and optionally sort key to efficiently retrieve items.

## How DynamoDB Works

1. **Create Table:** Define table name, primary key (partition key Â± sort key), and optionally provisioned throughput.
2. **Insert/Update Items:** Use PutItem or UpdateItem API.
3. **Query/Scan:** Retrieve data efficiently using partition key or indexes.
4. **Streams:** Capture changes for event-driven applications.
5. **Scaling:** On-Demand or provisioned throughput can automatically adjust.

## Practical Example: Creating and Using a DynamoDB Table

### Step 1: Create Table

* Table Name: `Employees`
* Partition Key: `EmployeeID` (String)
* Sort Key: `Department` (String)
* Billing Mode: On-Demand

### Step 2: Add Data

Using AWS CLI:

```bash
aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name Employees \
    --item '{"EmployeeID": {"S": "E001"}, "Department": {"S": "IT"}, "Name": {"S": "John Doe"}, "Salary": {"N": "75000"}}'

aws dynamodb put-item \
    --table-name Employees \
    --item '{"EmployeeID": {"S": "E002"}, "Department": {"S": "HR"}, "Name": {"S": "Jane Smith"}, "Salary": {"N": "85000"}}'
```

### Step 3: Query Data

```bash
aws dynamodb query \
    --table-name Employees \
    --key-condition-expression "EmployeeID = :id" \
    --expression-attribute-values '{":id":{"S":"E001"}}'
```

### Step 4: Use Streams and Trigger Lambda (Optional)

1. Enable DynamoDB Streams.
2. Create AWS Lambda function.
3. Configure Lambda as the event source to automatically process changes.

## Best Practices

1. Use **appropriate primary keys** for even data distribution.
2. Use **GSIs and LSIs** for alternate query patterns.
3. Use **On-Demand Mode** for unpredictable workloads.
4. Enable **PITR** for point-in-time recovery.
5. Monitor using **CloudWatch Metrics**.
6. Encrypt sensitive data and control access via **IAM**.

## Use Cases

* Serverless web/mobile applications
* Real-time analytics
* IoT data ingestion
* Gaming leaderboards
* E-commerce product catalog

## Pricing

Pricing depends on:

* Read and write requests (provisioned or on-demand)
* Storage usage
* Optional features like streams, backups, and global tables

## Conclusion

Amazon DynamoDB provides a highly scalable, low-latency, fully managed NoSQL database solution suitable for a variety of applications. Its serverless nature, combined with rich features like Streams, Triggers, and Global Tables, makes it ideal for modern application development and real-time data processing.
