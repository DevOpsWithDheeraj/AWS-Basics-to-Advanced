# Amazon Neptune 

## What is Amazon Neptune?

Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service provided by AWS that is optimized for storing, querying, and navigating highly connected datasets. It is designed to handle complex relationships and enables applications such as social networking, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs.

Neptune supports **two popular graph models**:

1. **Property Graph** – Queries are executed using **Gremlin**.  
2. **RDF (Resource Description Framework)** – Queries are executed using **SPARQL**.

## Key Features of Amazon Neptune

1. **Fully Managed Service**  
   AWS handles database provisioning, patching, backups, and hardware scaling.

2. **High Performance and Low Latency**  
   Neptune is optimized for querying highly connected data with sub-millisecond latency.

3. **ACID Compliance**  
   Ensures data consistency with transactions that are **Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable**.

4. **High Availability**  
   - Supports **Multi-AZ deployments** with automatic failover.  
   - Continuous backup to Amazon S3.  
   - Read replicas for horizontal read scaling.

5. **Supports Popular Graph Models**  
   - **Property Graph:** Uses TinkerPop Gremlin query language.  
   - **RDF Graph:** Uses W3C-standard SPARQL query language.

6. **Scalability**  
   - Storage automatically scales up to **64 TB** without downtime.  
   - Read replicas increase read throughput.

7. **Security**  
   - Supports **VPC, IAM, encryption at rest (KMS),** and **in transit (SSL/TLS)**.

## Neptune Architecture

1. **Primary Instance:**  
   Handles write operations and coordinates read requests.

2. **Read Replicas:**  
   Offload read traffic to improve query performance.

3. **Cluster Volume:**  
   A distributed, fault-tolerant storage system that replicates data across multiple AZs.

4. **Endpoints:**  
   - **Writer endpoint:** For write operations.  
   - **Reader endpoint:** Load-balanced endpoint for read replicas.

---

## How Amazon Neptune Works

1. Application sends graph queries to Neptune using **Gremlin** or **SPARQL**.  
2. Neptune processes the queries efficiently using an in-memory graph engine.  
3. For reads, queries can be routed to read replicas for higher throughput.  
4. Neptune automatically replicates data across AZs for durability.  
5. Continuous backups to S3 ensure disaster recovery.

## Practical Example: Social Network Friend Recommendation

### Scenario

An application wants to recommend friends to a user based on mutual connections in a social network.

### Step 1: Create a Neptune Cluster

```bash
aws neptune create-db-cluster \
    --db-cluster-identifier social-network-cluster \
    --engine neptune \
    --master-username adminuser \
    --master-user-password MyPass123
````

### Step 2: Create a Neptune Instance

```bash
aws neptune create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier social-network-instance \
    --db-cluster-identifier social-network-cluster \
    --engine neptune \
    --db-instance-class db.r5.large
```

### Step 3: Connect to Neptune

Use **Gremlin Python Client** or **SPARQL endpoint**.

```python
from gremlin_python.structure.graph import Graph
from gremlin_python.driver.driver_remote_connection import DriverRemoteConnection

# Connect to Neptune cluster
graph = Graph()
conn = DriverRemoteConnection('wss://<neptune-endpoint>:8182/gremlin', 'g')
g = graph.traversal().withRemote(conn)
```

### Step 4: Create Sample Graph Data

```python
# Add users
g.addV('User').property('id', 'u1').property('name', 'Alice').next()
g.addV('User').property('id', 'u2').property('name', 'Bob').next()
g.addV('User').property('id', 'u3').property('name', 'Charlie').next()

# Add friendships
g.V().has('id', 'u1').addE('FRIEND').to(g.V().has('id', 'u2')).next()
g.V().has('id', 'u2').addE('FRIEND').to(g.V().has('id', 'u3')).next()
```

### Step 5: Query for Friend Recommendations

```python
# Recommend friends for Alice (u1) based on mutual friends
recommendations = g.V().has('id', 'u1')\
    .both('FRIEND').both('FRIEND')\
    .where(__.not_(__.has('id', 'u1')))\
    .dedup().values('name').toList()

print(recommendations)
```

**Result:**
Alice would get "Charlie" as a recommended friend based on mutual connections.
