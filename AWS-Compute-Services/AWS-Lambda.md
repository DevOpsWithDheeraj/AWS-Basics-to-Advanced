# ‚ö° AWS Lambda

## üåê 1. What is AWS Lambda?
**AWS Lambda** is a **serverless compute service** that automatically runs your code **without provisioning or managing servers**.  
You just upload your code ‚Äî Lambda takes care of execution, scaling, and availability.  

> üí° Think of it as ‚Äúrun your code only when needed‚Äù ‚Äî AWS handles everything else!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. How to Configure AWS Lambda

1. **Open AWS Console** ‚Üí Go to **AWS Lambda** service.  
2. Click **Create Function** ‚Üí Choose:
   - **Author from scratch**  
   - **Container image** (from ECR)  
   - **Blueprint** (predefined template)
3. Enter Function name ‚Üí e.g., `MyFirstLambda`
4. Choose Runtime (e.g., Python 3.9, Node.js 18.x)
5. Choose or create an **Execution Role (IAM Role)** with Lambda permissions.
6. Add code (inline editor or upload `.zip` file / S3).
7. Configure a **Trigger** (like API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
8. Set **Memory**, **Timeout**, and **Environment Variables**.
9. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí then **Test** your Lambda function.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. How Does It Work?
1. **Trigger/Event Source** (like S3 upload, API call, or scheduled CloudWatch event) invokes Lambda.
2. **Lambda receives the event**, executes your function code in an isolated container.
3. **Scales automatically** ‚Äî Lambda launches as many parallel instances as needed.
4. **Stops automatically** when execution completes ‚Äî you pay only for compute time.

---

## üí° 4. Lambda Function
A **Lambda Function** is the core component ‚Äî your executable code plus configuration.  
Each function includes:
- **Handler** ‚Üí Entry point of execution.  
- **Runtime** ‚Üí Programming language environment.  
- **Memory & Timeout Settings**.  
- **Triggers** ‚Üí Sources that invoke the function.  
- **Execution Role** ‚Üí Defines AWS permissions.

Example (Python):
```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Hello from AWS Lambda!'
    }
````

---

## üì¶ 5. Lambda Layers

**Lambda Layers** are reusable packages of code or dependencies (e.g., libraries, SDKs).
They help reduce code duplication across multiple Lambda functions.

Example use cases:

* Common logging library shared by multiple functions.
* Machine Learning models or Python packages.

You can include **up to 5 layers** per function.

---

## üîî 6. Lambda Events

Lambda functions are triggered by **events** ‚Äî objects that describe what happened.

| Event Source        | Example Use Case              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**     | Run Lambda when API is called |
| **S3 Bucket**       | Process image/file upload     |
| **DynamoDB Stream** | Process DB changes            |
| **SNS/SQS**         | Process messages              |
| **EventBridge**     | Respond to system events      |
| **CloudWatch**      | Run on a schedule (cron)      |

Example S3 Event (JSON):

```json
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "s3": {
        "bucket": { "name": "mybucket" },
        "object": { "key": "photo.jpg" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üß© 7. Languages Supported

AWS Lambda supports multiple runtimes:

| Language | Runtime                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js  | nodejs18.x, nodejs20.x                        |

| Go       | go1.x                                         |
| Ruby     | ruby3.2                                       |
| .NET     | dotnet8                                       |
| Custom   | Container or Custom Runtime (via Runtime API) |

## üí∞ 8. Pricing

AWS Lambda charges are based on **compute time and requests**:

| Factor                      | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Requests**                | First 1 million requests/month are free   |
| **Duration**                | Charged per millisecond of execution time |
| **Memory**                  | You choose 128 MB ‚Äì 10 GB                 |
| **Compute Charges**         | Based on GB-seconds used                  |
| **Provisioned Concurrency** | Extra cost for pre-warmed Lambdas         |

> üí° **Free Tier:** 1M requests + 400,000 GB-seconds per month!

## üß† 9. Practical Example: Auto Thumbnail Generator

### Scenario:

When a user uploads a photo to **S3**, Lambda automatically creates a **thumbnail image**.

### Steps:

1. **Create S3 Bucket**

   * Bucket name: `my-photo-upload`
   * Enable event notifications for `PUT` object.
2. **Create Lambda Function**

   * Name: `ThumbnailGenerator`
   * Runtime: Python 3.9
   * Permissions: Allow read/write to S3
3. **Code Example:**

   ```python
   import boto3
   from PIL import Image
   import io

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
       key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
       
       # Get the uploaded image
       img_obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
       image = Image.open(img_obj['Body'])
       
       # Create thumbnail
       image.thumbnail((100, 100))
       buffer = io.BytesIO()
       image.save(buffer, 'JPEG')
       buffer.seek(0)

       # Upload to thumbnails folder
       s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=f"thumbnails/{key}", Body=buffer)
       return f"Thumbnail created for {key}"
   ```
4. **Trigger:**

   * Event Source: S3 (ObjectCreated:Put)
5. **Test:**

   * Upload an image ‚Üí Lambda runs ‚Üí Thumbnail saved in `thumbnails/` folder.

üéâ Result: Fully automated, serverless image processing system!

## ‚ö° 10. **Advantages of AWS Lambda**

1. **No Server Management**

   * You don‚Äôt need to provision, configure, or maintain servers ‚Äî AWS handles all infrastructure.

2. **Automatic Scaling**

   * Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests or events.

3. **Cost Efficiency (Pay-as-you-go)**

   * You only pay for the compute time consumed (measured in milliseconds), not for idle time.

4. **Event-Driven Execution**

   * Can be easily triggered by AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, SNS, API Gateway, CloudWatch, etc.

5. **Supports Multiple Languages**

   * Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, and custom runtimes via Lambda Runtime API.

6. **Quick Deployment**

   * Simple to upload and deploy code directly from the console or CLI without worrying about servers.

7. **Integrated Security**

   * Works seamlessly with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control.

8. **Built-in Fault Tolerance**

   * AWS Lambda runs functions across multiple Availability Zones automatically for high availability.

9. **Easily Connects with AWS Ecosystem**

   * Tight integration with AWS services makes it ideal for building serverless applications.

10. **Versioning and Aliases**

    * Allows maintaining different versions of functions and routing traffic between them.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 11. **Limitations of AWS Lambda**

1. **Limited Execution Time**

   * Maximum execution timeout is **15 minutes** per function invocation.

2. **Cold Start Latency**

   * First invocation after a period of inactivity may experience a delay (especially for large packages or Java-based functions).

3. **Limited Temporary Storage**

   * `/tmp` directory provides only **512 MB** of ephemeral storage (though expandable up to 10 GB).

4. **Memory and CPU Constraints**

   * Memory can be configured between **128 MB and 10 GB**, with proportional CPU ‚Äî not suitable for heavy compute tasks.

5. **Complex Debugging and Monitoring**

   * Harder to debug locally compared to traditional servers; relies on CloudWatch Logs.

6. **Vendor Lock-in**

   * Deep integration with AWS services can make migration to other platforms challenging.

7. **No Direct SSH Access**

   * You cannot log in to the runtime environment to inspect or troubleshoot directly.

8. **Concurrency Limits**

   * Each account has default concurrency limits (though can be increased via AWS Support).

9. **Deployment Package Size Limit**

   * The size of deployment packages (including dependencies) is limited ‚Äî **50 MB (zipped)** or **250 MB (unzipped)**.

10. **Not Ideal for Long-Running Applications**

    * Workloads requiring continuous processing (like streaming or large batch jobs) are not suitable for Lambda.
