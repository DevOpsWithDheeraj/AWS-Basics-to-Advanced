# ‚ö° AWS Lambda

## üåê 1. What is AWS Lambda?
**AWS Lambda** is a **serverless compute service** that automatically runs your code **without provisioning or managing servers**.  
You just upload your code ‚Äî Lambda takes care of execution, scaling, and availability.  

> üí° Think of it as ‚Äúrun your code only when needed‚Äù ‚Äî AWS handles everything else!

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. How to Configure AWS Lambda

1. **Open AWS Console** ‚Üí Go to **AWS Lambda** service.  
2. Click **Create Function** ‚Üí Choose:
   - **Author from scratch**  
   - **Container image** (from ECR)  
   - **Blueprint** (predefined template)
3. Enter Function name ‚Üí e.g., `MyFirstLambda`
4. Choose Runtime (e.g., Python 3.9, Node.js 18.x)
5. Choose or create an **Execution Role (IAM Role)** with Lambda permissions.
6. Add code (inline editor or upload `.zip` file / S3).
7. Configure a **Trigger** (like API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
8. Set **Memory**, **Timeout**, and **Environment Variables**.
9. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí then **Test** your Lambda function.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. How Does It Work?
1. **Trigger/Event:**

   * Lambda is invoked automatically by an event (e.g., an S3 upload, API Gateway request, or CloudWatch event).

2. **Execution:**

   * AWS runs your function code in a secure, temporary container with allocated memory and CPU.

3. **Scaling:**

   * Lambda automatically creates more instances of the function if multiple events occur simultaneously.

4. **Completion:**

   * Once execution finishes, AWS shuts down the container. You‚Äôre charged only for the execution time.

üëâ **In simple terms:**
**Event triggers function ‚Üí AWS runs code ‚Üí Scales automatically ‚Üí Stops when done ‚Üí Pay only for use.**


---

## üí° 4. Lambda Function
A **Lambda Function** is the core component ‚Äî your executable code plus configuration.  
Each function includes:
- **Handler** ‚Üí Entry point of execution.  
- **Runtime** ‚Üí Programming language environment.  
- **Memory & Timeout Settings**.  
- **Triggers** ‚Üí Sources that invoke the function.  
- **Execution Role** ‚Üí Defines AWS permissions.

Example (Python):
```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Hello from AWS Lambda!'
    }
````

---

## üì¶ 5. Lambda Layers

**AWS Lambda Layer** is a feature that lets you **package and share reusable code, libraries, or dependencies** separately from your main function code.

üëâ **In short:**
A **Layer** is like a **shared library** for Lambda ‚Äî you can include things like SDKs, custom modules, or configuration files without bundling them into every function.

**Example:**
If multiple Lambda functions use the same Python library, you can put that library in a **Layer** and attach it to all functions ‚Äî saving space and making updates easier.

> You can include **up to 5 layers** per function.

---

## üîî 6. Lambda Events

Lambda functions are triggered by **events** ‚Äî objects that describe what happened.

| Event Source        | Example Use Case              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**     | Run Lambda when API is called |
| **S3 Bucket**       | Process image/file upload     |
| **DynamoDB Stream** | Process DB changes            |
| **SNS/SQS**         | Process messages              |
| **EventBridge**     | Respond to system events      |
| **CloudWatch**      | Run on a schedule (cron)      |

Example S3 Event (JSON):

```json
{
  "Records": [
    {
      "s3": {
        "bucket": { "name": "mybucket" },
        "object": { "key": "photo.jpg" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üß© 7. Languages Supported

AWS Lambda supports multiple runtimes:

| Language | Runtime                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js  | nodejs18.x, nodejs20.x                        |

## üß† 9. Practical Example: AWS Lambda Function to Automatically Move Uploaded PDF, JPG, and TXT Files to Separate Buckets

### **Description:**

This Lambda function is triggered **automatically when a new object is uploaded** to an S3 source bucket.
It checks the **file type (extension)** and **copies** it to a **specific destination bucket** based on its type:

* **PDF ‚Üí pdf-bucket**
* **JPG ‚Üí image-bucket**
* **TXT ‚Üí text-bucket**

---

### **Python Lambda Function Code (Python 3.9 or later)**

```python
import boto3
import os

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract bucket name and object key from the event
    source_bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Extract file extension
    _, file_extension = os.path.splitext(object_key)
    file_extension = file_extension.lower()
    
    # Define destination buckets for each file type
    pdf_bucket = 'your-pdf-bucket-name'
    image_bucket = 'your-image-bucket-name'
    text_bucket = 'your-text-bucket-name'
    
    # Determine destination bucket based on file type
    if file_extension == '.pdf':
        destination_bucket = pdf_bucket
    elif file_extension in ['.jpg', '.jpeg']:
        destination_bucket = image_bucket
    elif file_extension == '.txt':
        destination_bucket = text_bucket
    else:
        print(f"Unsupported file type: {file_extension}")
        return
    
    # Copy file to destination bucket
    copy_source = {'Bucket': source_bucket, 'Key': object_key}
    s3.copy_object(CopySource=copy_source, Bucket=destination_bucket, Key=object_key)
    
    # Optional: delete the file from source after copying
    # s3.delete_object(Bucket=source_bucket, Key=object_key)
    
    print(f"File '{object_key}' moved from '{source_bucket}' to '{destination_bucket}'")

```

---

### **Setup Steps:**

1. **Create 4 S3 Buckets:**

   * `source-bucket` (upload files here)
   * `pdf-bucket`
   * `image-bucket`
   * `text-bucket`

2. **Create a Lambda Function:**

   * Runtime: **Python 3.9**
   * Role permissions:
     Add **S3FullAccess** (or fine-tuned policy for GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject)

3. **Add S3 Trigger:**

   * Configure the Lambda trigger for your **source bucket**
   * Event type: **‚ÄúAll object create events‚Äù**
   * Filter suffixes (optional): `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.txt`

4. **Deploy and Test:**

   * Upload a file (like `example.pdf`) to your source bucket
   * The Lambda will automatically copy it to the right destination bucket

## üß† 10. Practical Example: Auto Thumbnail Generator

### Scenario:

When a user uploads a photo to **S3**, Lambda automatically creates a **thumbnail image**.

### Steps:

1. **Create S3 Bucket**

   * Bucket name: `my-photo-upload`
   * Enable event notifications for `PUT` object.
2. **Create Lambda Function**

   * Name: `ThumbnailGenerator`
   * Runtime: Python 3.9
   * Permissions: Allow read/write to S3
3. **Code Example:**

   ```python
   import boto3
   from PIL import Image
   import io

   s3 = boto3.client('s3')

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       bucket = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
       key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
       
       # Get the uploaded image
       img_obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)
       image = Image.open(img_obj['Body'])
       
       # Create thumbnail
       image.thumbnail((100, 100))
       buffer = io.BytesIO()
       image.save(buffer, 'JPEG')
       buffer.seek(0)

       # Upload to thumbnails folder
       s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=f"thumbnails/{key}", Body=buffer)
       return f"Thumbnail created for {key}"
   ```
4. **Trigger:**

   * Event Source: S3 (ObjectCreated:Put)
5. **Test:**

   * Upload an image ‚Üí Lambda runs ‚Üí Thumbnail saved in `thumbnails/` folder.

üéâ Result: Fully automated, serverless image processing system!

## ‚ö° 11. **Advantages of AWS Lambda**

1. **No Server Management**

   * You don‚Äôt need to provision, configure, or maintain servers ‚Äî AWS handles all infrastructure.

2. **Automatic Scaling**

   * Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming requests or events.

3. **Cost Efficiency (Pay-as-you-go)**

   * You only pay for the compute time consumed (measured in milliseconds), not for idle time.

4. **Event-Driven Execution**

   * Can be easily triggered by AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, SNS, API Gateway, CloudWatch, etc.

5. **Supports Multiple Languages**

   * Supports Node.js, Python, Java, Go, C#, Ruby, and custom runtimes via Lambda Runtime API.

6. **Quick Deployment**

   * Simple to upload and deploy code directly from the console or CLI without worrying about servers.

7. **Integrated Security**

   * Works seamlessly with AWS IAM for fine-grained access control.

8. **Built-in Fault Tolerance**

   * AWS Lambda runs functions across multiple Availability Zones automatically for high availability.

9. **Easily Connects with AWS Ecosystem**

   * Tight integration with AWS services makes it ideal for building serverless applications.

10. **Versioning and Aliases**

    * Allows maintaining different versions of functions and routing traffic between them.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 12. **Limitations of AWS Lambda**

1. **Limited Execution Time**

   * Maximum execution timeout is **15 minutes** per function invocation.

2. **Cold Start Latency**

   * First invocation after a period of inactivity may experience a delay (especially for large packages or Java-based functions).

3. **Limited Temporary Storage**

   * `/tmp` directory provides only **512 MB** of ephemeral storage (though expandable up to 10 GB).

4. **Memory and CPU Constraints**

   * Memory can be configured between **128 MB and 10 GB**, with proportional CPU ‚Äî not suitable for heavy compute tasks.

5. **Complex Debugging and Monitoring**

   * Harder to debug locally compared to traditional servers; relies on CloudWatch Logs.

6. **Vendor Lock-in**

   * Deep integration with AWS services can make migration to other platforms challenging.

7. **No Direct SSH Access**

   * You cannot log in to the runtime environment to inspect or troubleshoot directly.

8. **Concurrency Limits**

   * Each account has default concurrency limits (though can be increased via AWS Support).

9. **Deployment Package Size Limit**

   * The size of deployment packages (including dependencies) is limited ‚Äî **50 MB (zipped)** or **250 MB (unzipped)**.

10. **Not Ideal for Long-Running Applications**

    * Workloads requiring continuous processing (like streaming or large batch jobs) are not suitable for Lambda.
