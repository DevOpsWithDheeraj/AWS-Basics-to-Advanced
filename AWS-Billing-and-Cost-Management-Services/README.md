## 1. AWS Cost Explorer

**Description:**  
AWS Cost Explorer is a tool to **visualize, analyze, and forecast your AWS costs and usage**. You can view data by service, linked account, tags, and more. It helps identify trends and detect unusual spending.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive charts to view daily, monthly, or custom time periods.
- Filter by service, region, linked account, or tag.
- Forecast future costs based on historical usage.
- Identify underutilized resources.

**Example Use Case:**  
A company wants to check how much they are spending on **EC2 and S3** over the last 3 months. Using Cost Explorer, they generate a chart showing **daily costs for EC2 vs S3**, helping them decide to resize EC2 instances to reduce costs.

## 2. AWS Budgets

**Description:**  
AWS Budgets allows you to **set custom cost or usage budgets** and receive alerts when you approach or exceed them. You can track costs, usage, or even Reserved Instance (RI) utilization.

**Key Features:**
- Budget types: Cost, Usage, Reserved Instances, Savings Plans.
- Alerts via email or SNS when thresholds are exceeded.
- Track budgeted vs actual costs.

**Example Use Case:**  
An organization sets a **monthly budget of $1,000** for development EC2 usage. If costs exceed **$800**, an email alert is triggered to the team to prevent overspending.

## 3. AWS Pricing Calculator

**Description:**  
The AWS Pricing Calculator helps you **estimate the monthly cost of AWS services** before deployment. It allows you to plan budgets and optimize architecture based on cost.

**Key Features:**
- Calculate costs for multiple services together.
- Customize configurations (instance type, storage size, data transfer, etc.).
- Generate detailed PDF or Excel reports.

**Example Use Case:**  
A startup plans to deploy a web application on **EC2, RDS, and S3**. Using the Pricing Calculator, they estimate:
- EC2: $150/month
- RDS: $200/month
- S3: $50/month  
Total estimated monthly cost = $400.  

This helps them plan their budget before launching.

## 4. AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR)

**Description:**  
AWS Cost and Usage Reports provide **detailed CSV or Parquet files** containing cost and usage information. These files are highly granular and suitable for **analytics and integration with BI tools**.

**Key Features:**
- Break down costs by service, account, region, and tags.
- Store reports in S3 for historical analysis.
- Integrate with Amazon Athena, QuickSight, or Redshift for deep analysis.

**Example Use Case:**  
A large enterprise exports **CUR data to S3**, then uses **Athena** to analyze EC2 usage by department, helping identify teams consuming the most resources.

## 5. Reserved Instance (RI) and Savings Plan Reporting

**Description:**  
AWS provides reporting for **Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans** to help you **maximize savings** by tracking utilization and coverage.

**Key Features:**
- **RI Utilization Report:** Shows how much of your RIs are being used.
- **RI Coverage Report:** Shows what percentage of usage is covered by RIs.
- Optimize RI purchases to reduce on-demand costs.

**Example Use Case:**  
A company has **10 m5.large EC2 RIs** in us-east-1. The **RI utilization report** shows only 70% usage. Based on this, they can either adjust RI allocation or sell unused RIs on the **AWS Marketplace** to save money.
