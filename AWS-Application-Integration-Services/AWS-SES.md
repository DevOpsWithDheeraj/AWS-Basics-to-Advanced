## 5. **Example 1: Transactional Email via AWS SES**

**Use Case:**
A website sends a verification email after user signup.

**Workflow:**

1. User registers on your website.
2. Lambda triggers an AWS SES **SendEmail API** call.
3. SES sends an email like:

   ```
   Subject: Verify your account
   Body: Hello Dheeraj, please click the link below to verify your account.
   ```
4. SES reports the status (Delivered, Bounced, etc.) to **CloudWatch** or **SNS**.

## **Example 2: Marketing Campaign Email**

**Use Case:**
Your company wants to send a monthly newsletter to 10,000 users.

**Workflow:**

1. You prepare your email template in SES.
2. You use **SES API** or **Amazon Pinpoint** integration to send in bulk.
3. SES manages sending limits, reputation, and tracking.
4. Reports are available via **SES Dashboard** and **CloudWatch metrics**.

## **Example 3: Receiving and Processing Emails**

**Use Case:**
You want to automatically process support emails.

**Workflow:**

1. Create an **SES rule set** to receive incoming emails.
2. Store the received emails in an **S3 bucket**.
3. Trigger a **Lambda function** to:

   * Parse the message
   * Create a ticket in your support system (like Jira or Zendesk)
