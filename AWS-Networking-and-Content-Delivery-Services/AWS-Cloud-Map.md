# AWS Cloud Map

## What is AWS Cloud Map?

**AWS Cloud Map** is a fully managed **service discovery** service offered by AWS. It allows you to **register and discover application resources**, such as microservices, databases, and other cloud resources, via friendly names rather than hard-coded IP addresses. Cloud Map integrates with **AWS services** like ECS, EC2, Lambda, and Route 53, enabling dynamic discovery of resources across your infrastructure.

Cloud Map solves the problem of **dynamic environments** where IP addresses and endpoints change frequently, especially in **microservices architectures**.

## Key Features of AWS Cloud Map

1. **Service Discovery**: Automatically discover resources using DNS or API calls.
2. **Health Checking**: Integrated health checks ensure that only healthy resources are discoverable.
3. **Custom Attributes**: You can assign metadata (like version, region, environment) to each resource.
4. **Multiple Namespaces**:
   - **Public DNS**: For internet-facing services.
   - **Private DNS**: For internal services inside a VPC.
   - **HTTP namespaces**: For API discovery.
5. **Integration with AWS Services**:
   - ECS Service Discovery for containerized applications.
   - Lambda function discovery.
   - EC2 or on-prem resources discovery.
6. **Flexible Query Methods**:
   - DNS queries.
   - AWS SDK API calls for programmatic discovery.
7. **Automatic Updates**: When a resource is registered or deregistered, Cloud Map updates DNS and API discovery endpoints automatically.

## Cloud Map Architecture

1. **Namespace**: A container for services. Can be **DNS-based** or **HTTP-based**.
2. **Service**: Represents a logical application component (like `payment-service` or `database`).
3. **Instance**: Represents an actual resource (like an EC2 instance or Lambda function) registered to a service.
4. **Health Check**: Optional checks to determine instance availability.
5. **Discovery Mechanisms**:
   - **DNS**: Resolves the service name to IP addresses of healthy instances.
   - **API**: AWS SDK/API calls return metadata and endpoints of registered instances.

**Flow**:

1. A service registers its instances in a Cloud Map namespace.
2. Clients query the service via DNS or API.
3. Cloud Map returns healthy instances along with metadata.
4. Applications dynamically connect to the service without hardcoding endpoints.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Configure AWS Cloud Map

### Step 1: Create a Namespace

1. Go to **AWS Management Console** → **Cloud Map** → **Create namespace**.
2. Choose **Namespace type**:
   - **DNS Private**: For internal services inside a VPC.
   - **DNS Public**: For internet-facing services.
   - **HTTP**: For service API discovery without DNS.
3. Enter a **Name** for the namespace (e.g., `myapp.local` for private).
4. If **Private DNS**, select the **VPC** where services are deployed.
5. Click **Create Namespace**.

### Step 2: Create a Service

1. Select the namespace → **Create Service**.
2. Enter **Service name** (e.g., `payment-service`).
3. Configure **Service discovery settings**:
   - **Enable health checks** (optional but recommended).
   - Set **health check type**: HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP.
   - Set **health check path**: `/health` for HTTP.
4. Define **Custom attributes** if needed (like version, environment).
5. Click **Create Service**.

### Step 3: Register Instances

- **Manual Registration**:
  1. Go to your service → **Register instance**.
  2. Provide instance ID, IP address, port, and optional attributes.
- **Automatic Registration**:
  - Integrate with **ECS service discovery**, **Route 53**, or use **AWS SDK** in your app to register instances dynamically.

### Step 4: Discover Services

#### Option 1: DNS Discovery

- If you created a DNS namespace, your service is accessible via:
```

payment-service.myapp.local

````
- Example:
```bash
nslookup payment-service.myapp.local
````

* Cloud Map returns the IPs of healthy instances.

#### Option 2: API Discovery

* Using AWS SDK:

  ```python
  import boto3

  client = boto3.client('servicediscovery')

  response = client.discover_instances(
      NamespaceName='myapp.local',
      ServiceName='payment-service',
      MaxResults=5
  )

  print(response['Instances'])
  ```
* Returns metadata and endpoints of registered instances.

## Practical Example: Microservice Discovery for ECS

### Step 1: Setup ECS Cluster

* Create ECS cluster and deploy 2 microservices: `payment-service` and `order-service`.

### Step 2: Create Private DNS Namespace

* Name: `internal.myapp.local`
* VPC: `vpc-123456`

### Step 3: Create Services in Cloud Map

* **Service Name**: `payment-service`
* **Health Check**: HTTP `/health`
* **Custom Attribute**: `version=1.0`

### Step 4: Enable ECS Service Discovery Integration

* In ECS task definition, enable **Service Discovery** → link to `payment-service`.
* ECS automatically registers task IPs with Cloud Map.

### Step 5: Discover `payment-service` from `order-service`

* Use DNS:

  ```bash
  curl http://payment-service.internal.myapp.local:8080/api/payments
  ```
* Or use AWS SDK API to programmatically fetch instances.

### Step 6: Verify Health Checks

* Only healthy instances are returned.
* Cloud Map automatically deregisters unhealthy instances.

## Best Practices

1. Use **private namespaces** for internal microservices.
2. Enable **health checks** to avoid sending traffic to unhealthy instances.
3. Use **custom attributes** for versioning and environment tagging.
4. Integrate Cloud Map with **ECS or Lambda** for automatic registration.
5. Use **DNS TTL settings** to balance caching and real-time discovery.

## Summary

AWS Cloud Map provides a robust mechanism for **service discovery**, helping microservices and applications dynamically locate resources without hardcoding IP addresses. It supports **DNS and API-based discovery**, integrates with health checks, and allows custom metadata, making it ideal for dynamic, cloud-native architectures.

**Practical Example**: Using ECS microservices, `payment-service` can be registered in a private namespace and discovered by `order-service` via DNS or API, ensuring seamless communication and high availability.
