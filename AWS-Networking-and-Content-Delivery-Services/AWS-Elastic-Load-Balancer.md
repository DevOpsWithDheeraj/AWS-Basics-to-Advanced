# 🌐 Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) 

## 📘 What is Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?

**Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** is a **fully managed service** that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple **targets** such as **EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses**.  
ELB ensures **high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability** for your applications by evenly distributing traffic and monitoring target health.

Key features:
- **Automatic traffic distribution**
- **Health checks** to route traffic only to healthy targets
- **Secure applications** with SSL/TLS termination
- **Integration** with AWS services like EC2, ECS, and Lambda

> Simply put, ELB ensures your application **remains available, scalable, and resilient** under varying traffic loads.

## ⚙️ How to Configure ELB

### Step-by-Step Configuration:

1. **Open EC2 Console**
   - Navigate to **EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer**

2. **Select Load Balancer Type**
   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Layer 7, HTTP/HTTPS routing
   - **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** – Layer 4, TCP/UDP, high performance
   - **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** – For third-party virtual appliances

3. **Configure Load Balancer**
   - Name: `MyApp-ELB`
   - Scheme: `Internet-facing` or `Internal`
   - IP address type: IPv4 or dualstack

4. **Configure Listeners**
   - Define ports and protocols (e.g., HTTP 80, HTTPS 443)
   - SSL certificate for HTTPS (from ACM)

5. **Configure Target Groups**
   - Targets: EC2 instances, IP addresses, or Lambda functions
   - Health check settings: path, protocol, and success codes

6. **Register Targets**
   - Add EC2 instances or IP addresses to the target group

7. **Configure Security**
   - Security groups allowing inbound traffic for listener ports

8. **Review & Create**
   - Confirm settings and create ELB
   - Obtain DNS name to access the load-balanced application

## 🧩 Types of Elastic Load Balancer

| Type | Layer | Use Case | Features |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) | Web applications, microservices | Path-based routing, host-based routing, WebSocket support, SSL termination |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) | High-performance, low-latency apps | Static IP, TLS termination, extreme scale |
| **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** | Layer 3 | Third-party appliances | Transparent network gateway for security & monitoring appliances |

---

## 🧩 Components of ELB

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes traffic across targets |
| **Listener** | Defines protocol and port for incoming traffic |
| **Target Group** | Logical grouping of targets (EC2, IP, Lambda) |
| **Targets** | Actual backend endpoints receiving traffic |
| **Health Checks** | Monitors target availability |
| **DNS Name** | Endpoint for client access (provided by ELB) |
| **Security Groups** | Control inbound/outbound traffic to ELB |

## 🌟 Use Cases

1. **Web Applications**
   - Distribute traffic across EC2 instances or containers

2. **Microservices**
   - Route requests to specific services using ALB

3. **High-Performance Applications**
   - Use NLB for low-latency and high throughput

4. **Hybrid Cloud Architecture**
   - Route traffic to on-premises servers via IP targets

5. **Security Integration**
   - Use GWLB to deploy security appliances without changing network design

---

## 🧱 Best Practices

1. **Use Multiple Availability Zones**
   - Ensure high availability

2. **Enable Health Checks**
   - Route traffic only to healthy targets

3. **Use SSL/TLS Certificates**
   - Terminate HTTPS at ELB for secure communication

4. **Use Auto Scaling with ELB**
   - Handle variable traffic automatically

5. **Monitor Metrics**
   - Use CloudWatch for latency, request count, and target health

6. **Choose the Right Load Balancer**
   - ALB for HTTP/HTTPS routing, NLB for TCP/UDP, GWLB for appliances

## 🧠 Practical Example: Web Application with ALB

### Scenario:
Distribute traffic to multiple EC2 web servers using **Application Load Balancer**.

### Steps:

1. **Launch EC2 Instances**
   - Create 2 EC2 instances running a simple web server

2. **Create ALB**
   - Name: `MyApp-ALB`
   - Scheme: `Internet-facing`
   - Listeners: HTTP 80

3. **Create Target Group**
   - Name: `MyApp-Targets`
   - Protocol: HTTP
   - Register the 2 EC2 instances as targets
   - Health check path: `/index.html`

4. **Security Groups**
   - ALB: Allow inbound HTTP 80 from `0.0.0.0/0`
   - EC2: Allow inbound HTTP 80 from ALB

5. **Test**
   - Access the ALB DNS name → traffic routed to EC2 instances
   - Stop one instance → traffic automatically routed to healthy instance

✅ You now have a **highly available web application** using ALB.
