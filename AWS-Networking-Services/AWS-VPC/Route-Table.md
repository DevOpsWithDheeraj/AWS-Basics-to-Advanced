## 🌐 What is a Route in AWS?

A **Route** in AWS defines **where network traffic should go** when it’s leaving your subnet or VPC.
It’s like a **GPS map for your network traffic** — it tells packets which “next hop” (target) to take to reach their destination.

Each route consists of:

| Field           | Description                                            | Example                                                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Destination** | The destination IP range (CIDR block) for the traffic. | `0.0.0.0/0` (anywhere on Internet) or `10.0.0.0/16` (your VPC)                                        |
| **Target**      | The next hop where traffic should be sent.             | `igw-xxxx` (Internet Gateway), `nat-xxxx` (NAT Gateway), `eni-xxxx` (Elastic Network Interface), etc. |

## 📋 What is a Route Table?

A **Route Table** is a **collection of routes** that determine how network traffic is directed within a VPC.

Every **subnet** in your VPC is **associated with one route table** — and that table defines where data from that subnet can go.

## ⚙️ Key Points About Route Tables

| Concept                 | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Route Table**    | Automatically created when you create a VPC. If you don’t explicitly associate a subnet with any route table, it uses this main table. |
| **Custom Route Table**  | You can create your own route tables for specific subnets to control traffic behavior.                                                 |
| **Subnet Association**  | Each subnet must be explicitly or implicitly associated with a route table.                                                            |
| **Local Route**         | Every route table automatically includes a “local” route that allows communication within the VPC. (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16 → local`)       |
| **Targets (Next Hops)** | Could be an Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Transit Gateway, Peering Connection, or Network Interface.                                  |

## 🧩 Example — Inside a VPC

Suppose you have a VPC:

```
CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
```

You create two subnets:

* **Public Subnet** → 10.0.1.0/24
* **Private Subnet** → 10.0.2.0/24

And you want:

* Public Subnet to access the Internet.
* Private Subnet to stay internal (but still reach the Internet for updates).

### 🔹 Route Table for **Public Subnet**

| Destination   | Target    | Meaning                                       |
| ------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | local     | Allow internal VPC communication              |
| `0.0.0.0/0`   | igw-12345 | Send all Internet traffic to Internet Gateway |

➡️ Any EC2 in this subnet will have **public Internet access**.

---

### 🔹 Route Table for **Private Subnet**

| Destination   | Target    | Meaning                                            |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | local     | Allow internal VPC communication                   |
| `0.0.0.0/0`   | nat-67890 | Send outbound Internet traffic through NAT Gateway |

➡️ EC2 in this subnet can **access the Internet outbound** (e.g., for software updates),
but **cannot receive inbound traffic** from the Internet.

## 💡 Important Routing Concepts

| Concept                              | Explanation                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local Route**                      | Present by default; allows communication between subnets in the same VPC.                                         |
| **Propagation**                      | Route tables can automatically learn routes from VPN, TGW, or DX connections if propagation is enabled.           |
| **Target Types**                     | IGW (Internet), NAT (Private to Internet), VPC Peering (cross VPC), TGW (multiple VPCs), ENI (specific instance). |
| **Explicit vs Implicit Association** | If you don’t associate a subnet explicitly, it uses the main route table by default.                              |

## 🧠 Best Practices

✅ Create **separate route tables** for public and private subnets.
✅ Always verify route table association when debugging connectivity issues.
✅ Use **descriptive names** (e.g., `public-rt`, `private-rt`).
✅ For security, ensure only necessary routes go to the Internet.
✅ Use **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor how traffic moves across routes.
