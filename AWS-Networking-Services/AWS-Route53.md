üõ∞Ô∏è What is Amazon Route 53?

Amazon Route 53 is AWS‚Äôs highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
It connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS‚Äîlike EC2 instances, S3 buckets, or CloudFront distributions‚Äîand can also be used to route users to non-AWS infrastructure.

In short:
üëâ Route 53 = DNS + Domain Registration + Health Check + Smart Routing

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features & Benefits

Feature	Description	Example

Domain Registration	Register and manage domain names directly from AWS.	You can buy mywebsite.com using Route 53.
DNS Service	Translates domain names into IP addresses.	Converts www.myapp.com ‚Üí 192.168.1.5
Health Checks	Monitors the health of endpoints and routes traffic only to healthy ones.	Checks if your web server is up every 30 seconds.
Traffic Routing Policies	Controls how traffic is distributed across resources.	Can route users to nearest server for low latency.
Integration with AWS Services	Works seamlessly with CloudFront, S3, EC2, Load Balancer, etc.	Automatically maps domain to your ALB.
Highly Available & Scalable	Built on AWS‚Äôs global DNS infrastructure.	Can handle millions of DNS queries per second.

üß© Main Components of Route 53

Component	Description

Hosted Zone	A container for DNS records that define how to route traffic for a domain (like example.com).
Record Set (DNS Record)	Each record inside a hosted zone that defines where to send requests (e.g., to an IP, load balancer, etc.).
Health Check	Route 53 pings your resources and ensures only healthy endpoints receive traffic.
Domain Registration	You can buy and manage your domain names from AWS.

üßæ Common DNS Record Types

Record Type	Description	Example

A (Address)	Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.	example.com ‚Üí 192.0.2.1
AAAA	Maps to an IPv6 address.	example.com ‚Üí 2001:db8::1
CNAME (Canonical Name)	Maps one name to another.	www.example.com ‚Üí example.com
MX (Mail Exchange)	Directs email to mail servers.	example.com ‚Üí mail.example.com
TXT	Stores text information (e.g., for verification or SPF records).	v=spf1 include:amazonses.com
NS (Name Server)	Specifies the name servers for the domain.	ns-123.awsdns.com
SOA (Start of Authority)	Contains info about the domain like admin contact and refresh rate.	Used internally by DNS.
Alias Record (AWS specific)	Special AWS record that maps to AWS resources (S3, CloudFront, ELB).	www.example.com ‚Üí ALB DNS name


üí° Alias vs CNAME:
Alias can map directly to AWS resources at the root domain level, while CNAME cannot.

üß† How Route 53 Works (Step-by-Step)

1. User enters URL:
User types www.example.com in a browser.


2. DNS Query begins:
Browser checks local DNS cache ‚Üí ISP‚Äôs DNS ‚Üí Root DNS server.


3. Root DNS refers to Route 53:
The root server identifies the .com TLD and directs query to Route 53 name servers (if your domain is hosted in Route 53).


4. Route 53 finds record:
Route 53 looks up the DNS record for www.example.com in the hosted zone.


5. Traffic routed accordingly:
Depending on routing policy and health checks, it returns the IP or endpoint (like ALB or CloudFront).


6. Browser connects to endpoint:
The user‚Äôs browser connects to that IP and loads the application.

üß≠ What Route 53 Provides

1. üè∑Ô∏è Domain Name Registration

You can buy and manage domains directly (e.g., mydevsite.com).

Automatically configures DNS with a hosted zone.

Supports domain transfers and WHOIS privacy.


Example:
Buy dheerajdevops.com in Route 53 ‚Üí It automatically creates a hosted zone for that domain.


---

2. üåê Domain Name Resolution (DNS Service)

Converts domain names into IPs.

You can create multiple record types inside the hosted zone.

Integrates with AWS resources like ALB, CloudFront, or S3 static websites.


Example:
www.myapp.com ‚Üí Alias ‚Üí myapp-load-balancer-123.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com


---

3. ‚ù§Ô∏è Health Checks

Route 53 continuously checks health of endpoints (HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP).

Can automatically failover to a backup server if primary fails.

Works with CloudWatch alarms for notifications.


Example:
If your web server in us-east-1 is down, Route 53 routes traffic to us-west-2 backup server.

üßÆ Routing Policies in Route 53

Routing Policy	Description	Example Use Case

Simple Routing	Routes traffic to a single resource.	One web server for example.com.
Failover Routing	Routes traffic to primary, switches to secondary if primary fails.	Disaster recovery setup with backup site.
Weighted Routing	Splits traffic by percentage among multiple resources.	A/B testing: 80% old version, 20% new version.
Latency-Based Routing	Routes user to the region with the lowest latency.	Asia users ‚Üí Singapore, US users ‚Üí Virginia.
Geolocation Routing	Routes traffic based on user‚Äôs geographic location.	Indian users ‚Üí India server, UK users ‚Üí London server.
Geo-Proximity Routing (Advanced)	Routes based on both location and bias value (using AWS Global Accelerator).	Send more users near Tokyo to Tokyo region.
Multi-Value Answer Routing	Returns multiple healthy IPs for load balancing.	Multiple web servers behind Route 53.

üìò Example Scenario

Let‚Äôs say you own www.dheerajdevops.com, hosted on two servers:

us-east-1: 192.168.1.10

us-west-1: 192.168.2.20


You can set:

Weighted routing ‚Üí 70% traffic to east, 30% to west.

Health checks ‚Üí If east fails, 100% to west.

Alias record ‚Üí Point domain to AWS ALB instead of IPs.

CNAME ‚Üí api.dheerajdevops.com ‚Üí backend.alb.amazonaws.com.
