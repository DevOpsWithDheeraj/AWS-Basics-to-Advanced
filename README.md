✅ **Completed till now:**
All above sections (Core to Monitoring) are completed — covering **Compute, Storage, Networking, IAM, Security, IaC, CI/CD, and Monitoring**.

Would you like me to **add a section for “Upcoming / To Learn Next” (e.g., AWS Glue, Athena, Redshift, CloudFront, etc.)** at the bottom?
I can also generate this syllabus as a downloadable `AWS.md` file.
