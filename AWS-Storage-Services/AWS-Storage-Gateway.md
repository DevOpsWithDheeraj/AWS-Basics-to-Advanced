# AWS Storage Gateway

## 1. What is AWS Storage Gateway?

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that connects on-premises environments with AWS cloud storage. It enables seamless integration of on-premises applications with AWS storage services like **S3, Glacier, and EBS**, providing secure, low-latency access to cloud storage while retaining local access for frequently used data.

It helps organizations **move backup, archive, and disaster recovery workloads to AWS** without major changes to their existing applications.

## 2. Types of AWS Storage Gateway

AWS Storage Gateway offers three main types:

### 1. **File Gateway**
- **Purpose**: Provides a file interface to store files as objects in S3.
- **Key Features**:
  - Access S3 objects using NFS or SMB protocols.
  - Automatic data upload to S3.
  - Local caching for low-latency access.
  - Supports S3 versioning, lifecycle policies, and encryption.
- **Use Cases**:
  - File backup and sharing.
  - Data archival to S3.
  - Hybrid cloud storage for applications.

### 2. **Volume Gateway**
- **Purpose**: Provides block storage volumes accessible via iSCSI.
- **Modes**:
  - **Cached Volumes**: Keep frequently accessed data on-premises; store full data in S3.
  - **Stored Volumes**: Store entire volume locally and asynchronously back up to S3.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports snapshots to S3 for backups.
  - Provides consistent point-in-time backups.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Disaster recovery.
  - On-premises storage extension.
  - Backup for virtual machines and databases.

### 3. **Tape Gateway**
- **Purpose**: Virtual tape library (VTL) for backup applications.
- **Key Features**:
  - Emulates physical tape libraries.
  - Stores virtual tapes in S3 and Glacier.
  - Supports existing backup software.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Tape-based backup replacement.
  - Long-term archival of backup data.
  - Disaster recovery storage.

## 4. How to Configure AWS Storage Gateway

### Step 1: Deploy the Gateway
- Choose deployment option: **VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, EC2, or hardware appliance**.
- Download the gateway VM image and deploy it on-premises or in AWS.
- Activate the gateway in the AWS console.

### Step 2: Configure Gateway Type
- Select **File, Volume, or Tape Gateway**.
- Connect to AWS storage service (S3, Glacier, or EBS).
- Assign local storage for caching (for File/Volume Gateway).

### Step 3: Configure Network and Security
- Connect gateway to on-premises network.
- Set up IAM roles, VPC, subnets, and security groups.
- Configure NFS/SMB/iSCSI access for your applications.

### Step 4: Create Storage Resources
- File Gateway: Create file shares pointing to S3 buckets.
- Volume Gateway: Create volumes and map to on-premises servers.
- Tape Gateway: Create virtual tapes for backup software.

### Step 5: Monitor and Manage
- Use **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring storage usage and performance.
- Enable automated snapshots and lifecycle management for cost optimization.

## 5. Pricing

- **Gateway Usage**: Hourly charge for the running gateway instance.
- **Storage**:
  - Data stored in S3, Glacier, or EBS is charged per GB/month.
  - Snapshot storage is charged separately.
- **Data Transfer**:
  - Inbound data transfer is free.
  - Outbound data transfer to on-premises may incur charges.
- **Tape Gateway**:
  - Charges for virtual tapes and their storage in S3/Glacier.
- Detailed pricing is available at [AWS Storage Gateway Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/pricing/).

## 6. Best Practices

- Enable local caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
- Use IAM policies to control access to S3 buckets.
- Automate snapshots for volume and tape gateways.
- Monitor gateway performance using CloudWatch metrics.
- Use lifecycle policies to transition data to lower-cost storage classes.
- Regularly test disaster recovery workflows for volume/tape gateways.

## 7. Practical Example: File Gateway for Hybrid File Storage

### Scenario
A company wants to store user-generated files in AWS S3 while allowing employees to access them locally over SMB.

### Steps
1. Deploy a **File Gateway** VM on the on-premises server.
2. Activate the gateway in AWS console.
3. Configure a **file share** pointing to an S3 bucket named `company-files`.
4. Set **local cache size** to 1 TB for frequently accessed files.
5. Configure access using Active Directory for SMB authentication.
6. Enable **S3 versioning** and lifecycle policy to move older files to Glacier Deep Archive.
7. Employees access files over SMB from their workstations.
8. AWS automatically uploads files to S3, ensuring durability and low-cost storage.

**Result:**  
The company now has a hybrid file storage solution: fast local access for employees and durable, scalable storage in AWS S3 with automated archival to Glacier.
