# üíæ AWS Storage Services

## ü™£ **1. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

**Amazon S3** is an object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is ideal for backup, archiving, analytics, and static website hosting.

### **Key Features:**
- Stores data as **objects** within **buckets**.
- Unlimited storage capacity.
- Versioning and lifecycle management for data retention.
- Integrated with AWS services like Lambda, CloudFront, and Glacier.
- Fine-grained access control using **IAM** and **Bucket Policies**.

### **Example:**
A company stores its website images, videos, and documents in S3. It uses S3 Lifecycle rules to automatically move old data to **Glacier** for cost savings.

## üíΩ **2. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)**

**Amazon EBS** provides **block-level storage** for EC2 instances. It is ideal for databases, applications, and workloads that require low-latency access to data.

### **Key Features:**
- Attached to EC2 instances as virtual disks.
- Persistent data storage (retains data even after instance termination).
- Supports snapshots for backup and recovery.
- SSD and HDD volume types based on performance needs.

### **Example:**
An EC2 instance hosting a MySQL database uses an **EBS volume** to store its database files. Daily **EBS snapshots** are taken for backup and disaster recovery.

## üóÇÔ∏è **3. Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)**

**Amazon EFS** is a **fully managed, scalable file storage** service for Linux-based workloads that can be shared across multiple EC2 instances simultaneously.

### **Key Features:**
- Automatically scales to petabytes of data.
- Provides shared access to multiple EC2 instances.
- Ideal for web serving, content management, and big data analytics.
- NFS (Network File System) compatible.

### **Example:**
A web application deployed on multiple EC2 instances uses EFS to share static website assets (like CSS, JS, and images) among all instances in real-time.

## üß± **4. Amazon FSx**

**Amazon FSx** provides fully managed, high-performance file systems built on popular file storage technologies.

### **Variants:**
- **FSx for Windows File Server:** Supports SMB protocol and integrates with Active Directory.
- **FSx for Lustre:** High-performance file system for compute-intensive workloads like machine learning and HPC.

### **Example:**
A financial analytics firm uses **FSx for Lustre** to process terabytes of market data in parallel using EC2 compute nodes.

## üßä **5. Amazon S3 Glacier (and Glacier Deep Archive)**

**Amazon Glacier** is a **low-cost archival storage** service designed for long-term backup and infrequently accessed data.

### **Key Features:**
- Retrieval options: Expedited (1‚Äì5 min), Standard (3‚Äì5 hrs), and Bulk (5‚Äì12 hrs).
- Ideal for compliance data, backups, and archives.
- Integrated with S3 Lifecycle rules for automatic data tiering.

### **Example:**
An insurance company stores claim records in **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** to comply with 7-year data retention policies while minimizing storage costs.

## üß© **6. AWS Storage Gateway**

**AWS Storage Gateway** is a hybrid storage service that connects on-premises environments with AWS Cloud Storage.

### **Gateway Types:**
- **File Gateway:** Store files in S3 using NFS/SMB protocols.
- **Volume Gateway:** Block storage that backs up volumes to S3.
- **Tape Gateway:** Replaces physical tape libraries with virtual tape in AWS.

### **Example:**
A data center uses **Tape Gateway** to back up its daily data to virtual tapes in S3 Glacier, eliminating physical tape handling and offsite storage costs.

---

## üì¶ **7. AWS Snow Family (Snowcone, Snowball, Snowmobile)**

The **AWS Snow Family** consists of physical devices that help transfer large amounts of data to and from AWS securely, especially when internet bandwidth is limited.

### **Members:**
- **Snowcone:** Small device (8 TB storage) for edge computing and small transfers.
- **Snowball Edge:** Rugged device (up to 80 TB) for bulk data transfer and local compute.
- **Snowmobile:** Truck-sized container for transferring exabytes of data.

### **Example:**
A media company uses **AWS Snowball Edge** to move 200 TB of 4K video footage to AWS for cloud-based editing and archiving.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **8. AWS Backup**

**AWS Backup** is a centralized backup service that automates and manages backups across AWS services like EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, and S3.

### **Key Features:**
- Automated and policy-driven backups.
- Centralized backup monitoring and reporting.
- Cross-region and cross-account backup support.
- Integration with AWS Organizations.

### **Example:**
An enterprise configures AWS Backup to take nightly backups of **RDS databases** and **EBS volumes** with a 30-day retention policy, ensuring compliance and disaster recovery readiness.
