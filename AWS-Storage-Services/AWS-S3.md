# AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) 

## 1. What is AWS S3?

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an **object storage service** provided by AWS that allows you to store and retrieve **any amount of data** from anywhere on the web. Unlike traditional file storage, S3 stores data as objects within **buckets**. 

Each object consists of:
- **Data:** The actual content.
- **Metadata:** Key-value pairs describing the object.
- **Unique Identifier (Key):** A unique name within the bucket.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Durability:** 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability.
- **Availability:** 99.99% availability for S3 Standard.
- **Scalability:** Automatically scales to handle any storage requirement.
- **Global Accessibility:** Objects can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
- **Security:** Fine-grained access control with IAM, bucket policies, ACLs, and encryption.

**Common Use Cases:**
- Backups and disaster recovery.
- Data lakes and big data analytics.
- Static website hosting.
- Archiving and long-term storage.
- Content distribution via CloudFront.
- Log storage and analysis.

## 2. How to Configure AWS S3

### Step 1: Create a Bucket
1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **S3** → **Create bucket**.
3. Enter a **unique bucket name** (globally unique) and select a **region**.
4. Configure optional settings:
   - **Versioning:** Enable to track object versions.
   - **Encryption:** SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, or SSE-C.
   - **Tags:** Add metadata for cost tracking.
5. Set **permissions** (block public access by default).
6. Click **Create bucket**.

### Step 2: Upload Objects
1. Open your bucket.
2. Click **Upload** → **Add files/folders**.
3. Choose **Storage class** and **Encryption**.
4. Add **Metadata** if needed.
5. Click **Upload**.

### Step 3: Configure Access
- **Public URL:** `https://<bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<object-key>`
- **Presigned URL:** Temporary URL with expiration (generated via CLI/SDK).
- **Access Control:** Use IAM roles, bucket policies, and ACLs.

### Step 4: Lifecycle Management
- Automate transitions between storage classes.
- Set expiration rules to delete old objects.
- Example: Move data older than 30 days to S3 Glacier.

### Step 5: Enable Logging and Monitoring
- Enable **Server Access Logging** to log all requests.
- Integrate with **CloudWatch** and **CloudTrail** for monitoring and auditing.

## 3. Properties of an S3 Bucket

| Property             | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Versioning**       | Keeps multiple versions of an object to protect against accidental deletes. |
| **Encryption**       | Server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C) or client-side encryption. |
| **Logging**          | Records bucket access requests.                                             |
| **Replication**      | CRR (cross-region) or SRR (same-region) replication for redundancy.        |
| **Tags**             | Key-value metadata for cost allocation or organization.                     |
| **Object Lock**      | Prevents accidental or malicious deletion (compliance).                     |
| **Static Website**   | Host static websites directly from S3.                                      |
| **Intelligent Tiering** | Automatic storage tiering to optimize cost.                               |

## 4. Storage Classes & Pricing Model

### S3 Storage Classes

| Storage Class                  | Use Case                                           | Pricing Model                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**                 | Frequently accessed data                         | Higher storage cost, low retrieval cost |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**      | Unknown access patterns                          | Automatically moves objects to cheaper tiers |
| **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** | Rarely accessed, fast retrieval                  | Lower storage cost, retrieval fee applies |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**              | Rarely accessed, single AZ                        | Cheaper than Standard-IA, retrieval fee applies |
| **S3 Glacier**                  | Long-term archive, retrieval in minutes/hours    | Very low storage cost, retrieval cost applies |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**     | Long-term archive, retrieval in 12 hours         | Lowest storage cost, retrieval cost applies |

**Pricing Components:**
1. **Storage Cost:** Per GB per month.
2. **Requests:** Charges for PUT, GET, LIST, COPY, DELETE.
3. **Data Transfer:** Costs for transferring data out of AWS.
4. **Lifecycle Transitions:** Charges for moving objects between classes.
5. **Glacier Retrieval Fees:** Cost varies based on retrieval speed.

## 8. Practical Example: Hosting a Static Website

### Step 1: Create a Bucket
- Bucket name: `example.com` (must match your domain)
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Enable public access (for website hosting)
- Enable **Static Website Hosting** in Properties

### Step 2: Upload Website Files
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
- Enable **Server-side Encryption (Optional)**

### Step 3: Configure Website Hosting
- Index Document: `index.html`
- Error Document: `error.html` (optional)
- Copy endpoint: `http://example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

### Step 4: Access Website
- Visit the S3 website endpoint to verify.

### Step 5 (Optional): Configure Custom Domain with Route 53
- Create an **A record** pointing to S3 endpoint.
- Use **CloudFront** for HTTPS and CDN.
