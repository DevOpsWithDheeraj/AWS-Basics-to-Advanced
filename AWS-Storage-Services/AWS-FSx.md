# AWS FSx: Complete Guide

## What is AWS FSx?

AWS FSx is a fully managed service that makes it easy to launch and run shared file systems in the cloud. It provides highly reliable, scalable, and fast file storage that is compatible with popular file systems. FSx eliminates the need to manage hardware, software, and backups for file storage, while providing high performance and security.

FSx supports multiple file system types for different workloads, including Windows-based applications, high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and big data analytics.

## Practical Example: Hosting a Windows File Share

### Scenario
You need a shared file storage for your Windows-based HR application that multiple employees can access securely.

### Steps
1. Go to AWS FSx Console → Create File System → FSx for Windows File Server.
2. Choose storage type: SSD, size: 1 TB.
3. Enable multi-AZ deployment for high availability.
4. Integrate with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD.
5. Configure security groups to allow SMB traffic from your EC2 instances or corporate network.
6. Enable daily automated backups.
7. Create user shares for HR team.
8. Mount the file system on EC2 instances or on-premises Windows machines using the SMB path.

Result: Your HR team now has a fully managed, highly available, and secure file storage accessible like a local network drive.
